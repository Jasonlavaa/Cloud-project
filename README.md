This is our project for the Cloud Computing class during the '22 spring semester. 
Our goal of the project was to develop and host a local Weather website using Amazon Web Services. 
For our project we use Amazon EC2 instances and services such as Load balencers and Auto scaling Groups.
This project was created by Jason Lavenant and David Grant.
